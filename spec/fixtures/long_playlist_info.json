At the core of his teachings lies the transformation of individual and collective human consciousness - a global spiritual awakening.\n\nEckhart Tolle is the author of The Power of Now, a #1 New York Times Bestseller, which has been translated into 32 languages and become one of the most influential spiritual books of our time.\n\nIn his most recent book, A New Earth, he shows how transcending our ego-based state of consciousness is not only essential to personal happiness, but also the key to ending conflict and suffering throughout the world.",

        "description": "In 2005, Eckhart was interview by 23 year-old actor Sean A. Mulvihill for the documentary film, \"Living Luminaries: On the Serious Business of Happiness.\"  In the two-day interview session, Eckhart taught on dozens of topics affecting Sean, a young man finding his way in the world.  In this 98 minute video, Eckhart touches on how to deal with illness and loss; how to navigate romantic relationships; how to achieve things in the world without getting lost in them; and Eckhart gives some insight into how he lived after his awakening but before he wrote The Power of Now.  \n\nThe full documentary film which features Eckhart's interview can be seen at  http://www.livingluminaries.com\n\nWhere is Sean (the guy who interviewed Eckhart in this video) now?

At the age of 29 a profound inner transformation radically changed the course of his life. He devoted the next several years to understanding, integrating, and deepening that transformation. With his international bestsellers, The Power of Now and A New Earth—translated into over 52 languages—he has introduced millions to the joy and freedom of living life in the present moment. The New York Times has described him as “the most popular spiritual author in the United States”, and Watkins Review has named him “the most spiritually influential person in the world.”\n\nEckhart’s profound, yet simple teachings have helped countless people around the globe experience a state of vibrantly alive inner peace in their daily lives. His teachings focus on awakening consciousness, which transcends ego and discursive thinking, and can be seen as the next step in human evolution. In the awakened state of presence, we discover what Eckhart describes as our essential identity—who we are beneath the surface—and its power for transforming our selves and our world.",
